# Exercise 1-4 : RoseBlanches.java

 A wealthy aunt sends you one day a small envelope, with money inside, to help you finance your studies. You decide to manage this amount as follows:
Three quarters of this sum will be dedicated to the purchase of books and supplies The rest will be evenly distributed between:
- Caf√©s
- subscription to the "Flash computer " journal
- subway tickets
You also decide to manage this sum in dollars changes. The rest of the money will be going to buy a flower bouquet for your mom for the next Mother's Day. Assuming that a cafe is worth 2 dollars, and a number of "Flash Computer" is worth 4 and that a subway ticket is worth 3 dollars, write the RoseBlanches.java program allowing you to produce the following output:
How much did you receive money ($)? 800 Book and Supplies: 600 $
You can then buy:
33 coffees
16 Flash Computer Numbers
22 subway Tickets
and you will have 4 dollars for the white roses.
Indication: use variables of type int. The result of a division of two int will be truncated to an int. Use the % operator that gives you the rest of the entire division.
